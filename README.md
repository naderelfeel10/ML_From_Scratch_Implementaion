# ML From Scratch (Recap)

As a recap of Machine Learning, I decided to **re-implement the fundamental models and concepts from scratch** using only Python and NumPy.  
The goal is to refresh my understanding of the math and core ideas behind each algorithm without relying on high-level libraries.

## Implemented
- Linear Regression (Gradient Descent & Normal Equation)
- Polynomial Regression & Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- Regularization: Ridge & Lasso
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- K-Means Clustering
- Basic Neural Networks

## Features
- Pure Python/NumPy implementations
- Visualizations with Matplotlib
- Comparisons with scikit-learn for validation
- Shows bias-variance tradeoff and effect of regularization
